    <ul>
      <li class=sequence>
	Outbus
	<p class=small>
	  Selects audio output bus.
	  <br>
	  Buses with names 'out_0', out_1, out_2, ... correspond to
	  sound card outputs.
	  <br>
	  The default bus, out_0, is the first output of the first sound card.
	  </p>
      </li>
      <li class=sequence>
	Outbus offset
	<p class=small>
	  The output bus offset is an index added to the SuperCollider bus
	  number.
	  <br>
	  This value is useful for selecting a specific bus from a
	  multi-channel bus.
	  <br>
	  Within SuperCollider there is no such thing as a true
	  multi-channel bus.
	  <br>
	  Instead buses are numbered sequentially and bus names may skip
	  over indexes.
	  <br>
	  All of the 'automatic' buses, out_0, out_1, out_2, etc..., are
	  single-channel.
	  <br>
	  Selecting bus_0 with an offset of 1 is equivalent to bus_1.
	  </p>
      </li>
      <li class=sequence>
	Key mode
	<p class=small>
	  Each synth is managed by a specific key mode which allocates
	  voices in response to incoming events.
	  <br>
	  Initially there are three key modes:
	  <ul>
	    <li class=small>
	      Poly1
	      <ul>
		<li class=small>
		  Allocates voices on the fly.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Has up to 128 voice polyphony (subject to system resources).
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Does not require resources if no notes are playing.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Does not maintain a 'history' between notes, features such as
		  portamento generally do not work.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  May not be fast enough for very complex synths?
		</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>

	    <li class=small>
	      Mono1
	      <ul>
		<li class=small>
		  Keeps a single voice active at all times.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Allows for monophonic trills.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Supports portamento.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>

	    <li class=small>
	      Efx
	      <ul>
		<li class=small>
		  Specialized keymode for effects.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Keeps single effects synth active at all times.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Keeps track of key count and passes 'gate'
		  information to the effect.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Passes keynumber, frequency and velocity of last key down
		  to the effect.
		</li>
		<li class=small>
		  Is only useful for effect synths, and not regular
		  'instrument' synths.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	  </ul>
	<p class=aside>
	  Additional specialized keymodes may be added later.
	</p>
      </li>
      <ul>
	<li class=sequence>
	  Voice count
	  <p class=small>
	    Sets the number of voices to allocate.
	    <br>
	    Voice count is included for possible future key modes and is
	    currently ignored.
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h5>Add Effects Dialog</h5>
    <p>
      The <em>Add Synth</em> and <em>Add Effect</em> dialogs are nearly
      identical.
      <br>
      The only real difference between them is that the add effects dialog
      has fields for audio input bus and is limited to the 'Efx' keymode.
    </p>

    <h5>Additional Bus And Buffer Parameters</h5>
    <p>
      If the synth has parameters for control buses are parameters,
      <br>additional fields appear for each parameter.
