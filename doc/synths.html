            Llia has three general synth types:</p>
            
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Regular &#34;Instrument&#34; synths</li>
            <li>Effect Synths</li>
            <li>Control Synths</li>
        </ol>
            <p class="section-body">
            The word &#34;synth&#34; may refer to any one of these types, hopefully
            context will make it clear which synth  type is being described.   Within
            each of these broad categories there are numerous specific synth types. <BR><BR>
            
            
            A <i>regular</i> synth is an instrument of some sort which may be
            played, such as an organ or synthesizer.  Concrete examples are the MASA
            organ and Saw3 synthesizer. All <i>regular</i> synths have at least one audio
            output. They typically have at least one control input. Conceivably they
            might also have audio inputs or control outputs, but this would be
            rare and no current instrument have these ports.<br><br>
            
            An <i>effect</i> synth is used to process signals external to itself.
             The input signal may come from an instrument synth, another effect or
            from the sound card audio inputs.  Effect synths will always have at least
            one audio input and one audio output.  They typically have at least
            one control input, but not always.  They might also have one or more
            control outputs.<br><br> 
            
            <i>Control</i> synths will always have at least one control output.  They
            may also have one or more control inputs.  They will never
            have audio ports of any kind.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            It is important to maintain a distinction between client side and server
            side synths.   A server side Synth is an active object running on the
            SuperCollider server.  We are rarely directly concerned with these as they
            are taken care of behind the scenes.  The synths that do concern us are on
            the client.   Technically these are instances of the python SynthProxy class.  
            Unless specifically noted the term
            &#34;synth&#34; refers to these client-side proxies and not to the objects
            on the server. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            All (client-side) synths share certain common features.  These include:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>A Program Bank</li>
            <li>A &#34;current&#34; program</li>
            <li>A keymode</li>
        </ul>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            A <a href="bank.html">program bank</a> is a collection of 128
            Programs.  Programs may be moved around within the bank or copy and pasted
            across banks of the same type.  Banks as a whole may be saved to external
            files.  A program contains values for all parameters of a synth. Each
            program also contains a <a href="performance.html">Performance</a>
            which is a collection of values related to how the synth responds to
            specific MIDI events.<br><br>
            
            A bank always has a <i>current</i> program which is selected either by MIDI
            program change events or by the user selecting it from a
            program list.<br><br>
            
            Each synth also has a <a href="keymode.html">keymode</a> which is specified
            when the synth is created.  The keymode controls how a synth is allocated
            in response to MIDI note events.  Not all synths work with all possible
            keymodes.  Effects and Control synths for example may only use the special
            <i>efx</i> keymode.  </p>
