            There are three general types of Llia synths:</p>
            
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Regular &#34;Instrument&#34; synths</li>
            <li>Effect Synths</li>
            <li>Control Synths</li>
        </ol>
            <p class="section-body">
            The word &#34;synth&#34; may refer to any one of these types, hopefully
            context will make it clear which synth  type is being described.   Within
            each of these broad categories there are numerous specific synth types. <BR><BR>
            
            
            A <i>regular</i> synth is a playable instrument 
            such as an organ or synthesizer.  
            <br><br>
            
            An <i>effect</i> synth is used to process signals external to itself.
             The input signal may come from an instrument synth, another effect or
            from a hardware audio input.  Effects will always have at least
            one audio input and one audio output.<br><br>
            
            <i>Control</i> synths will always have at least one control output.  They
            may also have one or more control inputs.  
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            It is important to maintain a distinction between client side and server
            side synths.   A server side Synth is an active object running on the
            SuperCollider server.  We are rarely directly concerned with these as they
            are taken care of behind the scenes.  The synths that do concern us are on
            the client.   Technically these are instances of the python SynthProxy class.  
            Unless specifically noted the term
            &#34;synth&#34; refers to these client-side proxies and not to the objects
            on the server.

            <p class="section-body">
            
            All (client-side) synths share certain common features.  These include:</p>
            
            
            <ul>
              <li><a href="bank.html">Program Bank</a><br>
                  Each type of synth has a specific <i>Program</i> type which contains values 
                  for all of it's parameters.<br>
                  Each Program contains a 
                  <a href="performance.html">Performance</a> which determines how the synth 
                  responds to specific MIDI events.  <br>
                  Programs are collected together into banks.
                  Every instance of an instrument has its own bank of 128 Programs.
              </li>
              <li><i>current</i> program. A bank always has a current program.  Initially
                 this is program 0.
              </li>
              <li>A <a href="keymode.html">keymode</a> which determines how the synth responds
                  to MIDI key events.</li>
            </ul>
