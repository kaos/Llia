               To conserve resources most synthesis systems, including SuperCollider,
               operate on at least two separate time scales
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Audio</li>
              <li>Control</li>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            A common audio rate is 44100 Hz which gives a time resolution of about 45
            micro-seconds.   Many signals, such as LFOs, envelopes, user input etc,  do
            not require anywhere near this level of resolution.  To save processor time
            these signals are updated at a much slower <em>control</em> rate.  A typical control
            rate is about 1 tenth the audio rate, for every 10 audio samples the
            control signals are updated once.

            <p class="section-body">
            
            Llia provides several control rate 
            <a href="glossary.html#synth">synths</a>
            which do not process or generate audio.   Instead they influence how other
            synths (including other control synths) operate. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="footnote">
            
            As with audio rate synths, the order in which two control synths are 
            created is meaningful but it is more relaxed.  Connections to and between
            control synths should always work, however there may be different results
            if the creation order of the control synths is different.

            <p class="section-body">
            
            Creating a control synth is no different from any other synth.  There will
            be no audio inputs or outputs, and there will be at least one control
            output, and perhaps one or more control inputs.  Control outputs appear on
            the top of graph icons, control inputs are on the bottom.
            </p>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            For illustration we'll use an LFO1 first for vibrato and then for combined
            vibrato and panning.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            From the main window, select the Controllers tab and add an instance of
            LFO1.
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/controlsynths/ctrl002.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Switching to the graph screen note that LFO1 has several outputs. When the
            mouse pointer moves into an output(or input) port, information about that
            port is displayed in the area to the left of the graph.  
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/controlsynths/ctrl003.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The port names can at times be a bit cryptic but you can always consult the
            synth documentation for details.   Typically the main output will have a
            name such as "outbus".  For LFO1, which is actually three
            LFOs in one, there are outputs for each individual LFO and a main output
            which combines the three signals. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Next from the Effects tab create an instance of Panner and from the Synth
            tab add a copy of MASA.   Using an audio bus patch MASA to the panner
            input, the graph should now look something like this:
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/controlsynths/ctrl004.png" alt="" />
            
            <p class="section-body">
               In the group window select each synth in turn and select the following
               programs:
            <p>
            <ul>
               <li>LFO1 [000] &#34;Delayed vibrato 5Hz&#34;</li>
               <li>Panner [000] &#34;Center&#34;</li>
               <li>MASA - [000] &#34;Albatross&#34;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Connecting control signals is no different then audio, except that
            <em>control buses</em> are used.  Click the +Control button to add a new
            control bus.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Control bus tokens are circular with input on the bottom and output at top.
            Connect the &#34;outbus&#34; output of LFO1 to the control bus and the
            control bus to the MASA control input.
            </p>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            Playing a few notes at this point should not sound any different.  This is
            because most synth programs have external signals turned off by default.
            Go back to the group window, select the MASA_2 tab and then the MASA
            editor.
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/controlsynths/ctrl006.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The <em>Pitch</em> slider in the <em>External</em> section controls how much the
            external control signal is applied to the pitch.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            To connect the LFO1 sawtooth output to the Panner, create another control
            bus and make the connections.
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/controlsynths/ctrl007.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Like MASA, the panner does not automatically use the external signal.
            Switch to the Panner editor and use the External &#34;Scale&#34; slider.
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/controlsynths/ctrl008.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Many effects, including the Panner, have internal control generators which
            are made available to the outside world.  The control output on the
            top of Panner is for connection to it's internal LFO.  The above patch can
            be simplified, at the cost of flexibility, by using the Panner's LFO
            as the vibrato source to MASA.
