Available Llia keymodes


; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
;				   Poly1

A basic polyphonic mode which creates and destroys synths as needed.
in response to key events.  In theory can have 128 note polyphony.

PROS:
   * Simple
   * Full polyphony
   * Only currently playing synths consume resources.

CONS:
   * May not be fast enough for complex instruments which are too
     expensive to create on the fly.
   * There is no continuity between synths.  This prohibits effects
     which rely on 'history' such as portamento or gated delays. 
 
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
;				   Mono1

A basic monophonic mode.  A single persistent synth instance is created
and then gated in response to key events.

PROS:
   * Fast.
   * Allows effects with history such as portamento or gated delays.
   * <Monophonic trills

CONS:
   * Monophonic
   * Persistent voice consumes resources even while not playing.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
;				    EFX

A monophonic mode specialized for effects.
A single persistent voice is created.

PROS:
  * Fast.
  * Allows effect synths to be treated more or less the same as any other
    synth within context of llia.
  * Passes gate, frequency, key number and velocity to synth should it care.
  * Gate signal held high as long as any key is depressed.  When all keys
    are lifted gate signal goes low.
