### synth_id

Many lliascript commands require a synth id to identify a specific active
instrument.  These values are strings with the form "synth_n" where synth
is the class of synthesizer and n is the unique integer id for a specific
instance of synth.


Several commands accept the special syntax "*" for the current synth.
