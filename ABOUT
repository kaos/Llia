Llia is an Open Sound Control (OSC) client for SuperCollider.  


Features:


1) An open set of SuperCollider synths.  Currently 37 separate synths,
effects, and control rate generators are implemented.
   
2) A comprehensive MIDI implementation allows mapping of most MIDI
   channel message values to synthesizer/effect parameters.

   A) Program banks with 128 slots per instrument.
   B) Random program generator for several synths.

3) Optional GUI mode. Llia may be executed with or without a GUI system.
   Synths and effects may be patched together graphically. 

4) Scripting via a simple Python API.  The scripting feature allows
   complex patches involving multiple instruments to be saved and
   later recalled.
