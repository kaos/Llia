Llia is an Open Sound Control (OSC) client for SuperCollider.  


Features:


1) An open set of SuperCollider synths.  These include both "instruments"
   and "effects".  At the time this is written (2016.07.25) there are four
   synthesizers and three effects:

    * Klstr uses clusters of pulse waves to produce a wide variety of
      electronic sounds.  The inspiration for Klstr comes from early,
      pre-sampler, drum machines which used a similar technique for
      cymbal and hi-hat sounds.  It tends to have a rather thin sound.

    * Orgn is a straight forward organ based on static FM tone
      generators.

    * RDrum is a percussive instrument synthesizer based on the
      Risset Drum algorithm.

    * Saw3 is a 3 oscillator subtractive synthesizer.

    * DirtyBurger is a delay effect with distortion and EQ in the
      feedback path.

    * StepFilter is a duel filter effect using complex stepped
      control signals.

   * XOver is another filter effect using complementary low and high
     pass filters,


2) A comprehensive MIDI implementation which allows mapping of most MIDI
   channel message values to synthesizer/effect parameters.


3) Optional GUI mode.  Llia may be executed with or without a GUI system.

4) Scripting via a simple Python API.
